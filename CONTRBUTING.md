# Contributing to Grumpy Linux
Grumpy Linux is a **work in progress**, and contributions will be considered after the core system is established.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Bug reports and feature requests are welcome via GitHub Issues.
- Feedback on design and system architecture is encouraged.
- Direct code contributions are **not yet open** while the core system is in development.

## Roadmap for Future Contributions
- System debugging and testing once a minimal OS is running.
- UI enhancements and optimizations once the desktop environment is functional.
- Packaging and repository management after core functionality is stable.

For discussions, please check out the GitHub Discussions section.
